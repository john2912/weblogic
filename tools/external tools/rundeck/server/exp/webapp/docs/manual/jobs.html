<p
>In previous sections of this manual, you learned how to execute ad-hoc commands across a filtered set of Node resources. This chapter introduces a fundamental Rundeck feature, <em
  >Jobs</em
  >. But first, one might ask why introduce another layer over ad-hoc command execution.</p
><p
>Here are some issues that might arise over time:</p
><ul
><li
  >One might find certain ad-hoc command executions are repeated, and perhaps, represent what has become a routine procedure.</li
  ><li
  >Another user in your group needs a simple self-service interface to run a procedure across a set of nodes.</li
  ><li
  >Routine procedures need to be encapsulated and become the basis for other routine procedures.</li
  ></ul
><p
>Jobs provide a means to encapsulate a procedure in a logically named Job. A <em
  >Job</em
  > is a configuration representing the steps in a procedure, a Node filter specification, and dispatcher execution control parameters. Jobs access is governed by an access control policy that describes how users are granted authorization to use Jobs.</p
><p
>Rundeck lets you organize and execute Jobs, and observe the output as the Job is running. You can view a list of the currently running Jobs that is dynamically updated as the Jobs progress. Jobs can also be killed if they need to be stopped.</p
><p
>Each Job has a record of every time it has been executed, and the output from those executions can be viewed.</p
><p
>The next sections describes how to navigate and run existing Jobs. In later sections, the topic of Job creation will be covered.</p
><p
>If you want to skip ahead, you can go straight to <a href="jobs.html#creating-jobs"
  >Creating Jobs</a
  >.</p
><div id="job-groups"
><h2
  ><a href="#TOC"
    >Job groups</a
    ></h2
  ><p
  >As many jobs will accumulate over time, it is useful to organize Jobs into groups. A group is a logical set of jobs, and one job group can exist inside another. Rundeck displays job lists as a set of folders corresponding to the group structure your jobs define.</p
  ><p
  >Beyond organizing jobs, groups assist in defining access control policy, as we'll cover later in the Authorization chapter.</p
  ></div
><div id="job-uuids"
><h2
  ><a href="#TOC"
    >Job UUIDs</a
    ></h2
  ><p
  >When created, each new job will be assigned a unique UUID. If you are writing the Job definition using one of the supported formats you can assign the UUID yourself.</p
  ><p
  >You can use the UUID to make sure that when you rename or change the group for your job in your job definition, it will modify the correct job in the server.</p
  ><p
  >The UUID is also useful when porting Job definitions between Rundeck instances.</p
  ><p
  >(Note: Rundeck also assigns each Job an internal &quot;ID&quot; value, although this value is not portable between Rundeck instances. As of Rundeck 1.3+ the UUID should be used in lieu of ID.)</p
