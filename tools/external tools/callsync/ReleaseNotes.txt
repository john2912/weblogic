Release Notes

1.8.0
	- Fixed the auto-login problem
	- Fixed the greyed settings problem

1.7.2
	-Fixed issue where CalSync would not start up minimized when the "Automatically
	 Sync" option was checked.
	-Implemented workaround for issue where the sync process would fail when syncing
	 large numbers of entries at once.  The Google API doesn't seem to handle long-
	 running processes gracefully.  CalSync will now implement updates in batches of
	 50 to prevent issues from ocurring.
	-Fixed new issue in 1.7 where CalSync would skip appointments in LN whenever there
	 was a To Do on the calendar.
	-Fixed issue where users could not login with their proxy settings unless the 
	 "Save passwords and automatically login" option was selected.

1.7.1545
	-Changes made to fix problems in 1.7 for those who use international date
	 formatting (thanks lionsh).

1.7 
	-Major changes were made to the way that CalSync retrieves calendar entries
	 from Lotus Notes. This should improve for all users, but performance will
	 be drastically better for users with large mailfiles.  In addition,
	 performance will be drastically improved for users with mailfiles on remote'
	 servers where network performance is not the best.  As a result of this 
	 change, all previously synced calendar entries will be updated the first time
	 version 1.7 is run.
	-Fixed bug where the default sync calendar was not saved where if the user's
	 selected the first calendar in the list to be the Default calendar (thanks
	 to cnybroe).
	-Reorganized some of the 'Settings' screens and added option on 'Reminders'
	 screen to use the Lotus Notes notifications that are already setup for each calendar
	 entry instead of using the default notification preferences setup for the 
	 destination Google calendar.

1.6
	-Minor performance enhancements for some users.
	-Added two flags to run CalSync from the command line.  The '/auto' flag will 
	 cause CalSync to open to the System Tray, login, run a sync, and then quit.  
	 The '/silent' flag will make the automatic login/sync process silent.  There
	 will be no windows, nothing in the taskbar, no icons in the system tray, and
	 no indication whether the sync was successful or not. *Note* that in order 
	 for the '/auto' flag to work correctly, the user must have logged in normally
	 and set the Save Passwords option.
	-Modified how saved passwords are encrypted and decrypted.  They are now 'salted'
	 with the credentials of the logged in user.  This means that if you are not 
	 running CalSync with the same user account, it will not be able to decrypt the
	 saved password.

     API bug, CalSync will change the location field to a dash if it is ever changed
     to a blank field after originally containing text.
